# AE4350: Bio-Inspired Intelligence Project
This is my(Henry Adam) project for the TU Delft Bio-Inspired Intelligence and Learning for Aerospace Applications class. The code implements a swarming algorihtm that is meant to create a 2D hexagonal lattice structure. 

### Running The Code
To test the code, simply run the simulation.py script and type in your options for number of agents, number of steps, target strut length, strut error bounds, and deposition speed. 

You will also be promped to chose between: 
1) A real-time simulation that saves no video, but saves a screenshot of the final structure
2) A run that does no real-time visualization but saves a screenshot of the final structure and gives text updates
3) A run that saves no final screenshot and does no visualization but saves a video of the construction
4) The full dataset, which will run a number of simulation scenarios as option #2, but takes quite a long time

### Important Caveat
Unfortunately, the code runs very slowly if you use lots of agents for lots of time. This is why I put in the video option, that way you can start the code, go grab a coffee(or take a day trip), and come back to watch the video.
